Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This is a calcuator to figure out the total monthly salary with putting in employees informationa and data. The problem that was solved in this app, was setting up a monthly budget of $20,000 max. When putting in employee information, the app divided the annual salary per employee and shows it on the total monthly. If it goes above $20,000 it will show up as red.
